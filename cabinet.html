            <p>Once upon a time I wrote poems in my physical journal. It was around that time that I began a little anthropological expedition of my own: collecting poems and quotes that I found beautiful. I found it remarkable how often I saw beautiful language come not just from ‘professional’ writers, but also from mathematicians, physicists, anonymous people on the internet, Instagram comments sections, and beyond.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you have a poem/quote/piece of language that you find yourself constantly coming back to, I would love to hear it!</p>
